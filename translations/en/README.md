# Numerical Methods
This repository contains a program with 6 numerical methods, which are listed below:

### Solution of single-variable equations
1. Bisection.
2. False Position.
### Solution of systems of equations
1. Linear (Gaussian Elimination).
2. Non-linear (Newton-Raphson).
### Others
1. Calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
2. Methods for approximating functions with coordinate tables.

## Notes and Credits
This program was a final project for the subject "Numerical Methods" at the University of Guanajuato, developed in collaboration with the following colleagues:
- Brandon Martínez
- Francisco Solis
- Miguel Gutiérrez
- Ricardo Adrián
- Samuel Villalpando
- Alejandro Pérez
- Jonathan Flores
- Juan Balderas

Some worked on the programming part, while others were involved in the documentation, which I no longer have access to since this code is from a few years ago.

If there is any issue with any of the methods, feel free to correct them and submit a pull-up request. The method I programmed was Newton-Raphson, so it is the only one that I tested with a larger number of examples compared to the others.
